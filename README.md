The project is written in C++. In addition to downloading the repository, you also need the open-source toolkit "open Frameworks" and the addon "box2d".

For this project I used the operating system MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4 and the Xcode version 9. 

Here are the links to openframeworks and to the addon "box2d"
