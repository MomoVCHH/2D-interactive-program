# 2D interactive program
The project is written in C++. In addition to downloading this repository, you also need the open-source toolkit "openFrameworks" and the addon "Box2d".
The folder "sounds" contains 55 sound samples in MP3 format, these sound samples are used as sound effect in the program.
When a big circle collides with another big circle, a sound effect produced by the piano will appear immediately.


For this project, I use the IDE Xcode (version 9). You also need to download openframworks and Box2D:
