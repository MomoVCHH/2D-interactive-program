# DancerBall
Dancer Ball Project for University
MyDancerBall is a C++ project. I used Openframeworks and Box2D addon to create it. I used the wave file "Dancer.wav" to create the background music. 

In my opinion this game project is suitable for children. 

For this project I used the operating system MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4 and the Xcode version 9. 

You need to download openframworks and Box2D to use it.
