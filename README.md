# 2D interactive program
The project is written in C++. In addition to downloading the repository, you also need the open-source toolkit "open Frameworks" and the addon "box2d".

For this project, I use the operating system MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4 and the the IDE Xcode (version 9). 

Here are the links to openframeworks and to the addon "box2d"
